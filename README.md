# Cybersecurity Portfolio Security Audit

## Overview
Audits help ensure that security checks are made, as well as monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organization's business continuity and critical assets.

## Background
*This scenario is based on a fictional company*

Botium Toys is a small U.S. busienss that develops and sells toys.  The business has a single physical location;
however, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad.  Their information
technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted.  She expresses
concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance as the
business grows.  She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company's infrastructure and help
them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets.  The manager is also
interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments, and conducting
business in the European Union (EU).

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity
Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing the assessment.  The goal of the
audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their
security posture.  The IT manager wants to use the audit finding as evidence to obtain approval to expand their
department.

This portfolio project task is to review the IT manager's scope, goals, and risk assessment.  Then, perform an
internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist.

#### Supporting Documents

*The Audit Scope and Goals and the Risk Assessment documents are located in the `Supporting Documents`
directory.*

The audit needs to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices.  The audit is 
meant to provide mitigration recommendations for vulnerabilities found that are classified as "high risk," and
present an overall strategy for improving the security posture of the organization.  The audit team needs to
document their findings, provide remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders.

#### Scope

The Botium Toys internal IT audit will assess the following:

1. Current user permissions set in the following systems:

	a. Accounting
	
	b. End-point detection
	
	c. Firewalls
	
	d. Intrusion detection system
	
	e. Security information and event management (SIEM) tool
	
2. Current implemented controls in the following systems:

	a. Accounting
	
	b. End-point detection
	
	c. Firewalls
	
	d. Intrusion detection system

3. Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems:

	a. Accounting
	
	b. End-point detection
	
	c. Firewalls
	
	d. Intrusion detection system

Questions to consider:

1. What are the biggest risks to the organization?  The biggest risks to the organization are twofold:
(a) the company does not have the necessary controls in place to protect its assets, and 
(b) the company is (likely) not in compliance with required regulations & standards protecting the privacy 
of its customer's data.

2. Which controls are most essential to implement immedately versus in the future?  First, the company should
immediately implement administrative controls that align the company's policies and procedures in a manner that
aligns with regulations regarding customer data privacy.  In the future, the company can pursue technical and
physical controls that implement the controls in accordance with the company's policies and procedures.
Essentially, the company must first develop the foundation for compliance with regulations via administrative
controls, then the company can proceed to build off that foundation with technical and physical controls that
support and enforce the policies and procedures detailed in the administrative controls.

3. Which compliance regulation does Botium Toys need to adhere to in order to ensure the company keeps customer
and vendor data safe, avoid fines, etc.?  Since the scenario specifically mentions that the company is wanting
to conduct business in European countries, the company would have to become compliant with the European Union's
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which involves (among other things) how companies should protect
and treat personally identifiable information (PII).
